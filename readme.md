# AUPHY 120 --- Experiment 8
Lab report for Experiment 8 --- Focal length of a converging lens.
A LaTeX installation is needed to compile this.

## Packages
The following packages are in use:
- `graphicx`
- `wrapfig`
- `microtype`
- `mathtools`
- `amssymb` (part of `amsmath`)
- `textcomp` (not sure where I used it but just in case)
- `siunitx`
- `parskip`
- `array`

## Compiling
``` bash
$ pdflatex report.tex
```
Run twice so the references show up --- otherwise it'll just show as (??).

## To-do
[ ] make LaTeX document
